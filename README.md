# Hasan — Personal Android Voice Assistant

> **Hasan** (حسن) is an Arabic given name meaning *beautiful*, *good*, *virtuous*. The name reflects the project's ambition: an assistant that is useful, well-crafted, and trustworthy — with no compromise on privacy.

---

## Philosophy

Hasan was born following the release and spread of **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/ykhli/hermes)**, a lightweight local LLM agent. The idea: build an Android voice client that connects to it, with no third-party cloud service involved.

**Three guiding principles:**

1. **Security** — no hardcoded secrets, everything goes through EncryptedSharedPreferences. TOFU (Trust On First Use) certificate verification for self-signed servers. The source code is auditable, no surprises.
2. **Lightness** — minimal pipeline: local ONNX wake word → native Android STT → SSE to Hermes → on-device TTS. No unnecessary dependencies, no proprietary third-party SDK.
3. **Maximum privacy** — the LLM and all message content stay on your own server. Wake word runs 100% locally (ONNX). The only external dependency is an optional, content-free wake-up signal via Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google sees only "wake up this device now", never the notification text) needed to receive proactive notifications while the app is fully closed, without a permanently running background service — disabled by default, degrades gracefully to WebSocket-only delivery if not configured (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). STT still depends on Google Speech Services (Whisper ONNX migration planned for V2).

## Architecture

```
[Permanent] HassanWakeWordService (PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK)
  AudioRecord 16kHz → ONNX pipeline:
    melspectrogram.onnx → embedding_model.onnx → ok_hasan_*.onnx
  Score > threshold → wake word detected
       │
       ├─ App foreground ──→ ConversationFragment (STT via ViewModel)
       │
       └─ App background ──→ WakeWordPipeline (STT → Hermes → TTS autonome)
                                     │
                                     ▼
                              HassanNotificationService (push notification)
       │
       ▼
[STT]  Android SpeechRecognizer (French) → final text
       │
       ▼
[WSS]  ConnectionManager — single persistent WebSocket to the relay server
       │  ChannelMultiplexer routes envelopes by channel: chat / bridge / system / proactive
       │  Exponential backoff reconnect, TOFU cert pinning, proactive
       │  ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback reconnect on network change
       ▼
[chat] ChatStreamHandler — streamChat() one envelope stream per turn
       │  chat/send → connecting → connected → thinking/token* → done (or error)
       │  Clarify support: chat/clarify ↔ chat/clarify_response (agent.clarify_callback)
       ▼
[UI]   Real-time chat bubbles (Compose)   [TTS] speaks once streaming completes
       │
       ▼
[Permanent] WakeWordService resumes (after TTS ends)

[bridge] BridgeCommandHandler — server-initiated device capability calls
  Confirmation dialog for sensitive capabilities (send_sms, get_location, get_contacts)
  before CapabilityExecutor runs them — see Capability.kt authRequiredDefault
```

Pairing with the relay is done once via QR code (`QrScannerActivity` → `PairingManager`), which stores a session token and refresh token in `EncryptedSharedPreferences`. No manual server URL/token entry required afterward.

## Features

- **Custom "Ok Hasan" wake word** — ONNX model trained on your voice, 100% local detection
- **Background wake word pipeline** — full STT → Hermes → TTS cycle runs even when the app is not in the foreground
- **Hot-swap model** — switch wake word model without restarting the app
- **Native Android STT** — voice recognition in French
- **WebSocket relay** — single persistent connection multiplexing chat streaming, device bridge commands, system events and proactive pushes; automatic reconnect with backoff and network-change detection
- **QR pairing** — one-time pairing flow, no manual token/URL entry
- **Clarify support** — Hermes can ask a clarifying question mid-turn (with choices or free text) before continuing
- **Device bridge with confirmation** — Hermes can request sensitive device actions (SMS, location, contacts); the app shows an Authorize/Deny dialog before executing
- **On-device TTS** — local speech synthesis, engine and voice selection
- **Dark premium UI** — 100% Jetpack Compose (Chat / Activity / Settings), cut-corner design system, wave animations
- **Room persistence** — full conversation history with sessions
- **Sessions** — multiple Hermes sessions, auto-titled from the first message, rename/delete from the drawer
- **Kanban board** — consult and move tasks between columns, create boards, powered by hermes-webui's existing Kanban API
- **Session files** — browse and download the active session's workspace (files the agent wrote), powered by hermes-webui's existing file-listing API
- **Push notifications** — background responses trigger Android notifications
- **FCM wake-up for proactive notifications** (optional) — receive Hermes-initiated notifications (e.g. cron job reminders) even while the app is fully closed, without a permanently running background service. Strictly data-only: Firebase only carries an opaque wake-up signal, the actual text is fetched afterwards from your own relay over TLS. Degrades gracefully to WebSocket-only delivery if not configured — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `SETUP.md`
- **Light Mode** — full-screen hands-free interface with large mic button, TTS mute, and wake word listening
- **TOFU certificate verification** — Trust On First Use for the relay's self-signed HTTPS/WSS
- **No external account** — no API key, no subscription required
- **Adaptive one-command deployment** — `server/install.sh` detects your Hermes install (native **or** containerised) and provisions accordingly: the relay and Caddy as Docker containers, and the `hasan_delivery` plugin dropped into wherever Hermes reads it. Refuses to run from inside a container, reuses an existing Caddy instead of colliding on port 443, and never modifies your Hermes install
